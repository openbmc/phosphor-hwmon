      "message": "Looking at how other applications handle power states with sensors, it looks like they use the Available interface instead of the functional one.  I think phosphor-hwmon should do the same so that there\u0027s consistent behavior.  See https://github.com/openbmc/dbus-sensors/blob/master/include/sensor.hpp#L373.   The Availability interface is in phosphor-dbus-interfaces, so it can be used here.",
