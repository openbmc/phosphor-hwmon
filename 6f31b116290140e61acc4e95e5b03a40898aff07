I feel like really you want to check that the power is applied, and not that instructions are running on processors?\n\nThere is also at least one new host state that may be coming:  https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-dbus-interfaces/+/27712/2/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Host.interface.yaml  which could affect this.",
