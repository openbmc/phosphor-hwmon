## To Build
```
To build this package, do the following steps:

    1. meson build
    2. ninja -C build

To clean the repository run `rm -rf build`.

## D-Bus bus names

```
To enable the use of Linux features like cgroups prioritization and
udev/systemd control, one instance of phosphor-hwmon is intended to
be run per hwmon sysfs class instance.

This requires an algorithm for selecting a stable, well-known D-Bus busname.

The algorithm is <PREFIX>-<ID>.Hwmon<N> where PREFIX is an autoconf
configurable prefix (BUSNAME_PREFIX, xyz.openbmc_project by default),
ID is either a std::hash of the /sys/devices path backing the hwmon class
instance or provided suffix value from the command line, and N is
the implemented phosphor-hwmon D-Bus API version.
```
